                    You may think, "hey! This site's format is a lot like your portfolio website!" And you are completely right!
                    I drew all the art and came up with the game-style concept! The code is a lot messier, and I used a lot of JS packages (DS, jQuery, etc).
                    However, I couldn't do this on my own. I am so grateful
                    for my team that allowed me to make my vision come true, while still allowing plenty of room for everyone to contribute 
                    their own ideas to the project! This project is my favorite because it fully showcases all of our personalities!
                    It is also my favorite because with such a diverse team (A math major, 2 computer science majors specialized in software and data science, 
                    and an astrophysics major), we all had to learn HTML on the spot within those 24 hours. It was a lot of hard work but we were able to 
                    cross those hurdles with teamwork. We even got animations working in the end!
                    (Btw, the aliens represent us!)
